For parts of the system written in C, you will require a standard
toolchain including gcc, make. etc. and the following libraries which
are not included in the distribution.

* libcrypto >= 0.9.8 from openssl available from http://openssl.org/source/
* expat available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/
* libpcap available from http://www.tcpdump.org
  * optional, needed for certain utilities only)
  * distributed with OSX 
*  libxml2 available from xmlsoft.org

In addition, you will need vlc and wireshark to build and use the CCNx
plugins for those packages.  Please see the individual README files
for more information.
